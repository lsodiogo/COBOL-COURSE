In this second part of the project there are 5 modules.
We are going to assign one module to each team member.
Even though each team member will be responsible for the respective module already assigned, the entire team will work together along the project.
Some rules are established by the team in terms of naming, formating, comments and programming style which are described below:
</br>
</br>

### VARIABLES
- All upper-case;
- If more than one word, should be separated by a hyphen;
- The variable levels are 1, 5, 10, 15, ...;
- In case we need to add a level between the variables already declared, we add 2 to the main level;
- The PIC clauses should all be aligned and the size should be written with 3 digits;
- The variable names will be defined by the team and used in all 5 modules without exception.
</br>

### PARAGRAPHS/SECTIONS
- All upper-case;
- If more than one word, should be separated by a hyphen;
- The program must be well structured with a good use of *PERFORM*;
- The use of *GO TO* are strictly forbidden.
</br>

### COMMENTS
- Explicit and objective with only the necessary information to interpret the programm;
- All the comments are separated by a line of "*" (above and below the comment) for better readability and visual harmony. 
</br>

### COMMON RULES
- Indentation is mandatory and is gonna be used along the project whether in the declaration of variables or in the code lines.

**EXAMPLE**:
<ul>

<ul>
05 SCHOOL-ADDRESS.
<ul>      
10 CPNUM. </br>
88 CPNUM-VALIDO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VALUE 1000000 THRU 9999999.
<ul>
15 CPNUM1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PIC 9(004).
<ul>
88 CPNUM1-VALIDO &nbsp;&nbsp; VALUE 1000 THRU 9999.
</ul>
15 CPNUM2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PIC 9(003).
<ul>
88 CPNUM2-VALIDO &nbsp;&nbsp; VALUE 000 THRU 999.
